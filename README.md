# Possum tappable

Simple mixin comforming to [possum](http://mnichols.github.io/possum/) API
for intercepting calls to instances.

This is handy especially for testing, but also when eventing isn't desired
but observing a possum instance is needed.

See test [here](test/tappable-test.js) for example.
